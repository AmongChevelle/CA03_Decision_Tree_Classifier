Make sure to complete this particular step to avoid issues with running the decision tree visualizations in the notebook.

## Running the Notebook

Once you have installed the prerequisites and Graphviz, you can run the notebook `CA03_Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb` by opening it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and executing the cells in order.
The notebook has %pip install commands preset so that if any packages are not already installed on the device you are using to run the notebook, it will install them for you. 
If you know that you already have all of the packages in the notebook, feel free to comment/remove them out before running the notebook.
